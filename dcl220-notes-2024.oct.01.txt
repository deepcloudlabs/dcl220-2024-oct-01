OOP
Modeling -> Class -> Members
                     i. attribute/state/data/property -> static
                    ii. method/behaviour/function/message -> dynamic
            Class -- create --> Object
            I. encapsulation -> Class
               information hiding
            II. inheritance -> reusability
            III. polymorphism -> agility
